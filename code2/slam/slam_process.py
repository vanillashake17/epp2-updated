slam_process.py - SLAM background process.

This module contains the function that runs in a dedicated child process to
perform SLAM.  Running SLAM in a separate process gives it its own Python GIL,
so heavy LIDAR reading and map-building never stalls the terminal UI.

The process reads LIDAR scans, resamples them into fixed-size angle bins, and
feeds them into BreezySLAM's RMHC_SLAM algorithm.  The resulting robot pose
and occupancy map are written into a ProcessSharedState object that the UI
process can read at any time.

Scan resampling
---------------
The RPLidar reports measurements at irregular angles.  BreezySLAM expects a
fixed array of SCAN_SIZE evenly-spaced readings.  The resampling step bins raw
readings by their rounded angle (0-359 degrees) and averages any multiple
readings that fall in the same bin.  Bins with no readings are filled with
MAX_DISTANCE_MM (treated as "no obstacle detected").
